# the-education-game
This project is an educational game for children with autism, intended to improve their development in 3 skill areas: arithmetic, emotion recognition, and fine motor skills. It uses Arduino and Processing for more tactile interactivity, prompting users to push buttons and turn knobs to answer questions displayed on the screen. It was originally started as a class project, and was further developed after the semester finished.
